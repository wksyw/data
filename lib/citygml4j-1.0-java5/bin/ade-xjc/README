3. About
--------

"ade-xjc" is a command line tool and a wrapper for the XML Schema compiler
"xjc" shipped with JAXB. ade-xjc compiles an arbitrary CityGML ADE Schema 
to a set of corresponding JAXB classes. The resulting classes are automatically
derived from the JAXB classes shipped with citygml4j. Thus, the classes can 
easily be used with the citygml4j library. However, this also requires the 
citygml4j library on your classpath in order to use the compiled classes in
your application.


4. System requirements
----------------------

* Java JRE or JDK >= 1.5
* citygml4j library version 1.0


5. How to use it
----------------

ade-xjc is a command line tool. In order to get a list of supported 
arguments, invoke the tool in a shell environment like this:

  > java -jar ade-xjc.jar -help

The ade-xjc compiler requires your ADE schema to point to the official
CityGML and GML schemas provided in the subfolder "schemas". So please 
adapt all <xs:import> statements in your ADE schema accordingly before 
invoking the ade-xjc compiler!

Please find a sample ADE schema together with an ANT build file in the
subfolder "sample".
